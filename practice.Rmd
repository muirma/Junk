# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r label="pressure", echo=FALSE, fig.width=4,fig.height=4,fig.align='center',fig.cap="this is a title"}
plot(pressure,col="blue",pch=19)

```


$$\bar{x}=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{x_i}{n}$$

The average pressure for the arctic 'pressure' dataframe is `r round(mean(pressure$pressure),2)` mm.

## are you here?

The sample mean is defined in Equation \@ref(eq:mean).

\begin{equation}
\bar{x}=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{x_i}{n}
(\#eq:mean)
\end{equation}



Please refer to Figure \@ref(fig:pressure)


## Insert URL
```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/best-ever-fried-chicken/")


```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
